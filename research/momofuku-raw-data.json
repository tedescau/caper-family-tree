      "There is no restaurant called 'Moonburger' -- Moon Palace was David Chang's burger concept in Las Vegas (closed 2022).",
      "Anoop Pillarisetti's title at Momofuku was VP of Technology, not a traditional 'leadership' role in the chef/restaurant sense.",
      "Paddy Spence leads Momofuku Goods specifically, not the restaurant group."
